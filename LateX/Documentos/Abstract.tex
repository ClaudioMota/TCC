This document describes the research and implementation of methods for generating HDR images using LDR images as input. There is, in literature, a lot of former works that presents methods of generating high dynamic range images like the works of Mann and Picard who appear to be the first method proposed in history, Robertson~\etal method which look the problem at statistical view and the method of Sen~\etal who cares about the robustness in relation to moviment between the input LDR images. The main objective of this work is to define a viable method for generating HDR images that will be used as input for a later work of obtaining a 3D point cloud from HDR images. The results obtained were satisfactory for all methods implemented, so it was decided, for the next step, to use the method which is more robust in relation to moviment.
